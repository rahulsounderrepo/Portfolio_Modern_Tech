# Rahul Sounder — Portfolio (Static)

This repository contains a simple static landing page scaffold for an executive-grade portfolio for Rahul Sounder.

Files added:

- `index.html` — static landing page using Tailwind CDN. Open directly in the browser.
- `resume-Rahul-Sounder.pdf` — placeholder file. Replace with your real resume PDF.

How to preview

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `Open With` in VS Code).
2. Replace the placeholder profile SVG in the hero by adding a portrait at `public/assets/profile.jpg` (recommended size ~600x600px). The Next.js starter uses this path and falls back to an SVG when missing.
3. Replace `resume-Rahul-Sounder.pdf` with your real resume PDF (same filename) to enable the download CTA.

Next steps (recommended)

- Replace placeholder links (`LinkedIn`, `GitHub`, `Medium`) with your real profiles.
- Convert to a Next.js + Tailwind project for server-side rendering and SEO if desired.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for resume and person to improve discoverability.
- Consider minor accessibility audit: color contrast, keyboard nav, and proper image alt text.

If you want, I can:

- Convert this to a Next.js + Tailwind app and wire resume download and contact form.
- Generate a printable one-page executive resume from the data provided.
